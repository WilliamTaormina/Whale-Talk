## Loops, Loops, all about Loops

### What I learned:

#### For Loops:

* _for_ loops let us loop a block of code, a know number of times.

Example:

```
let gitHubRepos = ['DogYearsCalc', 'Magic8Ball', 'RaceRegistrationApp'];

for (let i=0;i<gitHubRepos.length;i++){
 console.log(gitHubRepos[i]);
}
```

#### While Loops:

* _while_ loops let us loop a block of code, while a certain condition is true.
